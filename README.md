#### Run Server
`uvicorn main:app --reload --port 9000`


chmod +x runserver.sh
# # run server: ./runserver.sh


we can take input from users as ->
1. How many task they want to create
2. priority level of tasks, lets provide option to provide percentage, lets say we can provide p0 p1 and p2 fields to which they can assign  a percentage

What i'm unsure about:
1. What will be the task?
2. What will be its execution context?
3. When and how will it be completed
